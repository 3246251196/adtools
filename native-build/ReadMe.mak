Kurz:          GCC basierende Toolchain fÃ¼r AmigaOS 4.x
Requires:      OS 4.1
Version:       ${DIST_VERSION}

This archive includes native AmigaOS 4.1 compiles of binutils ${BINUTILS_VERSION}, gcc ${GCC_VERSION}, and
coreutils ${COREUTILS_VERSION} based on sba1/adtools version ${DIST_VERSION} commit ${ADTOOLS_COMMIT_SHA1}.

In order to install it on your Amiga, extract the archive to a destination of your choice.
Then establish a GCC: assignment to the extracted folder and add the contained bin folder to
the command search path
  1> ASSIGN GCC: <extracted folder>
  1> PATH GCC:bin add

Furthermore, you need to have an SDK: assign as in the original SDK.

This is a preliminary version and as such they contain still many bugs. Please use the Issue
tracker at https://github.com/sba1/adtools for reporting bugs.

Note that the plan is to split the project and move the parts to separate subprojects at
https://github.com/adtools/. Evtually, the projects will be part of one of the next AmigaOS
SDK.
