This is an attempt to simplify the building of a native
compiler suite targeting AmigaOS4.

You must have checked out the entire trunk directory
of the adtools project. In addition, the
branches/gcc/4.5.x directory must be checked out in
the same location as it is in the subversion repository.
That is, the checked-out layout should look like this

  adtools/trunk
  adtools/branches/gcc/4.5.x

The makefile first builds the cross compiler. For this
to be successful, your build machine, among other things,
needs the development packages of
 libgmp (libgmp-dev on Debian)
 libmpc (libmpc-dev on Debian)
 libmpfr (libmpfr-dev on Debian)

Note that the makefile accesses remote resources during
the build, so you also need a working Internet connection.

If you have met the requirements, you just need to invoke
  make
in the directory where you opened this file.
