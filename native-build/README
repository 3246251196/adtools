This is an attempt to simplify the building of a native
compiler suite targeting AmigaOS4.

You must have checked out the entire trunk directory
of the adtools project. In addition, the
branches/gcc/4.5.x directory must be checked out in
the same location as it is in the subversion repository.
That is, the checked-out layout should look like this

  adtools/trunk
  adtools/branches/gcc/4.5.x

The makefile first builds the cross compiler. For this
to be successful, your build machine, among other things,
needs the development packages of
 libgmp (libgmp-dev on Debian)
 libmpc (libmpc-dev on Debian)
 libmpfr (libmpfr-dev on Debian)

Other required packages are:
 lha
 bzip2
 wget

Note that the makefile accesses remote resources during
the build, so you also need a working Internet connection.

During the build process, a directory /gcc is accessed. Make
sure that the user under which you build the package, has
write access to this directory.

If you have met the requirements, you just need to invoke
 make
in the directory where you opened this file. If all goes
through without any error, you shall invoke
 make install
to get native compiler including coreutils copied to /gcc.
You shall be able to deposit the contents for this directory
on your Amiga.
