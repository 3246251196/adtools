This branch contains the result of the svn2git conversion of the build and packaging
parts of the adtools repository. To populate it, following command will be used

  git svn clone file:///home/sba/amiga/adtools.svn/code/trunk \
    --include-paths "packaging|native-build|binutils-build|gcc-build|native-build" \
    --ignore-paths "(README.packaging|before-merge-with-binutils-2.18)" \
    --use-svnsync-props \
    --authors-file ~/scripts/svn2git-authors

where in /home/sba/amiga/adtools.svn/code/ the svnsync'ed or rsync'ed repositoy is located.
The --use-svnsync-props makes sure that the orginal URL is written in the metadata that is
added to each commit.

The branch will then be freed from empty commits using:
  git filter-branch --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

Note that the code in the branch will not work in isolation. Its only purpose is to preserve
the evolution of the build an packaging procedure of the adtools project.
