Some basic sources to test the compiler.

For some tests you need a ```qemu``` installation that emulates a
PowerPC-based machine. Version 2.0 of Qemu seems to be enough.
Additionally, you need the ```wdiff```package. If these
requirements are met, can run the automated tests by invoking
the the ```run-all``` make target.
```
 $ make run-all
```
